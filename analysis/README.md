# Analysis Module

[← Back to Project Root](../README.md)

This directory contains tools for recording, storing, and analyzing vehicle path data.

## Directory Structure

### `recorded_data/`
Contains the raw and processed data from vehicle runs.
- **`original_run/`**: Data from the initial/reference run.
- **`smoothed_run/`**: Data from runs using the smoothed path.
- **`output.pickle`**: The graph data generated by the mapping tool.

### `recording/`
Scripts related to data acquisition. See the [Recording Documentation](recording/README.md) for detailed instructions.
- **`record_ros.py`**: A ROS node script to record vehicle pose (`/ndt_pose`) and steering (`/mpc/steer_angle`) to CSV files.

## Scripts

### `compare_pickles.py`
Compares two graph pickle files (`output.pickle`) to analyze differences in node positions and attributes (Yaw, etc.).
```bash
python compare_pickles.py path/to/run1/output.pickle path/to/run2_folder
```
```bash
python analysis/compare_pickles.py analysis/recorded_data/original_run/utput.pickle analysis/recorded_data/smoothed_run/output.pickle
```

### `compare_runs.py`
Compares recorded CSV vehicle data (trajectory, steering, speed) between two runs.
```bash
python compare_runs.py recorded_data/run1 recorded_data/run2
```
```bash
python analysis/compare_runs.py analysis/recorded_data/original_run analysis/recorded_data/smoothed_run
```

### `compare_lanes.py`
Analyzes lane data from `.npy` files.
> **Note:** This script currently uses hardcoded paths in `__main__`. You may need to edit it to point to your specific data files.

### `analyze_buggy.py`
Additional analysis utilities for debugging vehicle behavior.
> **Note:** Requires manual configuration of input file paths within the script.
